ASSERT is powered by volunteers and donations which help us grow and make an impact greater than we can now. Your donations will go towards training volunteers, purchasing essentials such as animal feed, as well as helping us secure necessary equipment that allows us to work more efficiently and resourcefully in our rescue efforts.
